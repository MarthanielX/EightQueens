# EightQueens

Finds all solutions to problem of putting n queens on a nxn chessboard such that none of queens can take each other and prints to a file.

I saw Dave Musciant's code to solve this problem a few weeks before and refereced it when writing my code, but I wanted to go about it a slightly different way, marking unavailable squares as queens are placed rather than checking every time we try to place a new queen. I also wrote it to find all solutions and print them to a file rather than printing the first solution it finds to the screen.
